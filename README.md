Shane Ridoux (he/him) is a first-year Master of Science in Statistics student at CU Denver and a Pathways in Genomic Data Science Fellow. Orignally from New Jersey, Shane graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Trinity University in San Antonio. Under the supervision of Dr. Joanne Cole in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/dbmi) and the [Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/ccpm), he applies statistical methods to large scale genomic data. He has previously investigated predicted gene expression in the development of Type I Diabetes and is excited to explore the complex interactions between health and genetics. His vision for precision medicine is as follows: "Precision medicine will provide the right treatment to the right person at the right time and at the **right price**."

Beyond his academic pursuits, he enjoys exploring Colorado's national parks, crafting natural soap, making pizza, and playing basketball.
